# The parameter `penalty` can control the **type** of regularization to use,
# whereas the regularization **strength** is set using the parameter `C`.
# Setting`penalty="none"` is equivalent to an infinitely large value of `C`. In
# this exercise, we ask you to train a logistic regression classifier using the
# `penalty="l2"` regularization (which happens to be the default in
# scikit-learn) to find by yourself the effect of the parameter `C`.
#
# We start by loading the dataset.

# On this series of plots we can observe several important points:
#
# - the darker the color, the more confident the classifier is in its
#   predictions. Indeed, the darker the color, the closer the predicted
#   probability is to 0 or 1;
# - for lower values of `C` (stronger regularization), the classifier is less
#   confident in its predictions (the near-white area is larger);
# - for higher values of `C` (weaker regularization), the classifier is more
#   confident: the areas with dark blue (very confident in predicting Adelie)
#   and dark red (very confident in predicting Chinstrap) nearly cover the
#   entire feature space;
# - the direction of the straight line separating the two classes is impacted
#   by the choice of `C`: the smaller `C` (the higher the regularization), the
#   more the decision bounday is influenced almost uniformly by all the
#   datapoints: the decision boundary is almost perpendicular to the "Culmen
#   Length (mm)" feature.
# - the higher the value of `C` (the weaker the regularization), the more the
#   decision boundary is influenced by few traing points very close to the
#   decision boundary, in particular by the misclassified points caused by the
#   presence of noise in the data, making this classification task non-linearly
#   separable.
# - also note that for small values of `C`, the decision boundary is almost
#   vertical: the model is almost only using the feature named "Culmen Length
#   (mm)" to make its predictions. We will explain this behavior in the next
#   part of the exercise.
# - finally, the 2 classes are imbalanced: there are approximately two times
#   more Adelie than Chinstrap penguins. This explains why the decision
#   boundary is shifted to the right when `C` gets smaller. Indeed, when `C` is
#   near zero, the model is nearly always predicting the same class probability
#   almost everywhere in the feature space. This class is the one that matches
#   the proportion of each class in the training set. In our case, there are
#   more Adelie than Chinstrap penguins in the training set: as a results the
#   most regularized model predicts light blue almost everywhere in the feature
#   space.

# We see that a small `C` will shrink the weights values toward zero. It means
# that a small `C` provides a more regularized model. Thus, `C` behaves as the
# inverse of the `alpha` parameter in the `Ridge` model.
#
# Besides, with a stronger penalty (e.g. `C = 0.01`), the weight of the feature
# named "Culmen Depth (mm)" is almost zero. It explains why the decision
# separation in the plot is almost perpendicular to the "Culmen Length (mm)"
# feature.
#
# For even stronger penalty strengths (e.g. `C = 0.0001`), the weights of both
# features are almost zero. It explains why the decision separation in the plot
# is almost constant in the feature space: the predicted probability is only
# based on the intercept of the model.
